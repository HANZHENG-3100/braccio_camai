Project's description
=====================

Using an Arduino `Tinkerkit Braccio Robot`_, `Raspberry Pi 3`_ and a `Google Coral USB Accelerator`_, it allows you to actively track and follow more that 90 different type of objects autonomously. 
It is also fully integrated in ROS (Robot Operating System) using `MoveIt`_ or a simple Joint interface, and uses state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection or classification powered by `TensorFlow Lite`_.
